
ONCE UPON A TIME IN A WORLD UNLIKE OUR OWN THERE EXISTED A LAND KNOWN AS PANDORA 
THIS VIBRANT WORLD WAS FILLED WITH LUSH FORESTS TOWERING MOUNTAINS AND BREATHTAKING 
OCEANS THE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF PANDORA WERE THE NAVI TALL BLUE BEINGS WHO LIVED 
IN HARMONY WITH NATURE

AMONG THE NAVI THERE WAS A YOUNG WARRIOR NAMED NEYTIRI SHE WAS SKILLED AND BRAVE 
PROTECTING HER TRIBE FROM ANY DANGERS THAT LURKED IN THE FORESTS NEYTIRI WAS DEEPLY 
CONNECTED TO HER HOME AND BELIEVED IN THE SACRED BOND BETWEEN HER PEOPLE AND THE SPIRITS 
OF NATURE

ONE DAY HUMANS FROM A DISTANT PLANET ARRIVED ON PANDORA THEY SOUGHT TO EXTRACT VALUABLE 
MINERALS DISREGARDING THE BALANCE OF NATURE THAT THE NAVI HELD DEAR A CORPORATION 
SENT THESE HUMANS TO TAKE WHAT THEY WANTED BELIEVING THEY WERE SUPERIOR TO THE NAVI

THE HUMANS CREATED AN ADVANCED PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED THEM TO REMOTELY CONTROL NAVILIKE 
AVATARS JAKE SULLY A FORMER MARINE WAS SELECTED TO BE PART OF THIS PROGRAM HE WAS 
EXCITED YET CONFLICTED ABOUT HIS MISSION ON PANDORA AS HE ENTERED HIS AVATAR BODY HE 
FELT THE INCREDIBLE STRENGTH AND AGILITY OF THE NAVI

JAKES MISSION WAS TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE FOR THE HUMANS BUT HE SLOWLY BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND
THE NAVI CULTURE AS HE SPENT TIME WITH NEYTIRI AND HER TRIBE HE LEARNED THEIR WAYS AND 
FELT A GROWING LOVE FOR THE LAND THE MORE HE LEARNED THE MORE HE REALIZED THE DESTRUCTION 
THE HUMANS WERE CAUSING

NEYTIRI TAUGHT JAKE ABOUT THE SACRED RITUALS OF THE NAVI INCLUDING THE CONNECTION TO EYWA
THE LIFE FORCE OF PANDORA HE WITNESSED BREATHTAKING MOMENTS INCLUDING THE BEAUTY OF 
BIOLUMINESCENT PLANTS AND THE GRACE OF FLYING CREATURES CALLED BANSHEES EACH MOMENT 
DEEPENED HIS BOND WITH NEYTIRI AND THE WORLD AROUND HIM

AS TIME PASSED JAKE FACED A CHOICE HE COULD EITHER CONTINUE SERVING THE HUMANS OR STAND 
WITH THE NAVI TO PROTECT PANDORA THE CORPORATION DRIVEN BY GREED MADE PLANS FOR A 
MASSIVE ATTACK ON THE NAVI HOMELAND AND JAKE KNEW HE COULD NOT REMAIN SILENT

WITH HIS HEART TORN BETWEEN TWO WORLDS JAKE MADE A BOLD DECISION HE JOINED NEYTIRI AND 
THE NAVI IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST THE HUMANS TOGETHER THEY RALLIED THE TRIBES OF PANDORA 
UNITING AGAINST THE THREAT THAT LOOMED OVER THEIR SACRED LAND

THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE NAVI AND THE HUMANS WAS FIERCE AND INTENSE THE HUMANS ARMED WITH 
ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY UNDERESTIMATED THE STRENGTH AND DETERMINATION OF THE NAVI WITH COURAGE
AND UNITY THE NAVI FOUGHT FOR THEIR HOME AND THE BALANCE OF LIFE ON PANDORA

IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE JAKE REVEALED HIS TRUE LOYALTY TO THE NAVI HE COMMANDED THE SUPPORT
OF THE CREATURES OF PANDORA JOINING FORCES WITH NATURE TO COUNTER THE MACHINES OF 
DESTRUCTION THE SKIES FILLED WITH THE CRIES OF THE BANSHEES AS THEY SOARED INTO BATTLE

AS THE DUST SETTLED THE NAVI EMERGED VICTORIOUS THEY PROVED THAT THE POWER OF NATURE 
AND UNITY COULD TRIUMPH OVER GREED AND DESTRUCTION THE HUMANS RETREATED REALIZING THEIR 
QUEST FOR RESOURCES HAD COME AT A GREAT COST

IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE NEYTIRI AND JAKE STOOD TOGETHER LOOKING OVER THEIR 
HOMELAND THE BOND THEY SHARED HAD GROWN STRONGER BUILT ON LOVE RESPECT AND A COMMITMENT 
TO PROTECT PANDORA JAKE MADE A DECISION TO REMAIN IN HIS AVATAR BODY EMBRACING HIS NEW 
LIFE AMONG THE NAVI

JAKE SULLY BECAME A TRUE MEMBER OF THE NAVI TRIBE ADOPTING THEIR CUSTOMS AND 
PHILOSOPHIES HE DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO PRESERVING THE BEAUTY OF PANDORA AND TEACHING 
OTHERS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HARMONY WITH NATURE NEYTIRI BECAME HIS PARTNER AND 
TOGETHER THEY INSPIRED FUTURE GENERATIONS

THE STORY OF JAKE AND NEYTIRI SPREAD THROUGHOUT PANDORA REMINDING EVERYONE OF THE 
IMPORTANCE OF UNITY AND RESPECT FOR NATURE THE LEGACY OF THE NAVI AND THEIR CONNECTION TO 
EYWA LIVED ON ENSURING THAT THE LESSONS LEARNED WERE NEVER FORGOTTEN

FROM THAT DAY FORTH PANDORA THRIVED FILLED WITH LAUGHTER ADVENTURE AND THE MAGIC 
OF LIFE THE NAVI CONTINUED TO HONOR THEIR ANCESTORS LIVING IN PEACE AND BALANCE WITH 
THE WORLD AROUND THEM THEIR TALE BECAME A SYMBOL OF HOPE TEACHING ALL THAT LOVE AND 
UNDERSTANDING CAN OVERCOME EVEN THE GREATEST CHALLENGES

AND SO THE TALE OF AVATAR REMAINED ETCHED IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO CALLED PANDORA HOME
A TIMELESS REMINDER OF THE POWER OF CONNECTION AND THE BEAUTY OF THEIR WORLD 
EACH GENERATION PASSED DOWN THE STORIES ENSURING THAT THE BOND BETWEEN THE NAVI 
AND PANDORA WOULD ENDURE FOR ALL TIME
